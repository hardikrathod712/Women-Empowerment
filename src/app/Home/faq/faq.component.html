        <strong><h2>Why are these schemes necessary for Women in India? </h2></strong>
        <p>The principle of gender equality is enshrined in the Indian
            Constitution in its Preamble, Fundamental Rights,
            Fundamental Duties and Directive Principles. The Constitution
            not only grants equality to women, but also empowers the state
            to adopt measures of positive discrimination in favour of
            women. ‘Empowerment’ may be described as a process which
            helps people to assert their control over the factors which affect
            their lives. Empowerment of women means developing them
            as more aware individuals, who are politically active,
            economically productive and independent and are able to make
            intelligent discussion in matters that affect them. Present
            article discusses about various initiatives taken by Government
            of India for empowering women by analysing position of India
            in Gender Inequality Index and Global Gender Gap Index of
            United Nations. Article concludes with the note that due
            recognition must be given to women and society should come
            forward to ensure equal status for women in all spheres of
            life.</p>
        
        <strong><h2>What is Naari Shakti Foundation? </h2></strong>
        <p>The broad mandate of Ministry is to have holistic development of Women and Children. As a nodal Ministry for the advancement of women and children, the Ministry formulates plans, policies and programmes; enacts/ amends legislation, guides and coordinates the efforts of both governmental and non-governmental organisations working in the field of Women and Child Development. Besides, playing its nodal role, the Ministry implements certain innovative programmes for women and children. These programmes cover welfare and support services, training for employment and income generation, awareness generation and gender sensitization. These programmes play a supplementary and complementary role to the other general developmental programmes in the sectors of health, education, rural development etc. All these efforts are directed to ensure that women are empowered both economically and socially and thus become equal partners in national development along with men.</p>
